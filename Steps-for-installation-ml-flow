Traffic Prediction Experiment with MLflow

This script trains traffic prediction models using LSTM and GRU architectures and logs the experiments using MLflow for easy tracking of parameters, metrics, and artifacts (including trained models and logs).

Instructions:
1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install mlflow tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the experiment:
   python starter-notebook-phase-1-mlflow.py

3. Start the MLflow UI:
   mlflow ui
   Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000

4. View experiment logs and metrics:
   - Click on the experiment in the MLflow UI
   - View the logged parameters, metrics, and artifacts (like train.log)

5. Download logs:
   - In the MLflow UI, go to the Artifacts section of the run
   - Download the train.log file or other saved models
